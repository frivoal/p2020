	<h1>Background</h1>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Motivation: Problems</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Developing and evolving</strong> a Specification is currently difficult:
				<ul>
					<li>Complex specs spend years in <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> without patent protection as details are refined prior to <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>.
					<li>Continuous development means tracking reality is a never-ending task. Declaring part of a spec as a <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> by pulling out not-yet-normative features is obnoxious busywork to engineers who work on a continuous basis.
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Maintaining</strong> a Specification is currently difficult:
				<ul>
					<li>Bug fixes can appear at all times, and some may need to be addressed urgently (security fixes).
					<li>Multiple transition requests and <abbr title="Technical Report">TR</abbr> publications take extra time/resources, demotivating maintenance of <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>s.
				</ul>
		</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h1>Motivation: Evidence</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Out-of-date specifications</strong> hinder interoperability and understanding, yet many W3C specifications are either unmaintained, or maintained in unofficial publications, because posting official updates through the current Process is too burdensome.
			<li>Work is shifting <strong>out of W3C Working Groups</strong> to Community Groups and WHATWG because of these maintenance problems.
		</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Constraints: W3C Values</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>W3C values <strong>wide review</strong>, <strong>implementation experience</strong>, <strong>consensus</strong>, and <strong>royalty-free licensing</strong> as a means of developing well thought-out, implementable, and relevant specifications.
		<li>Key <strong>role of the Process</strong> is to ensure these values are deeply incorporated into W3C’s standardization process.
		<li>W3C Process needs to be a supportive framework that solicits excellence from both <strong>experienced standards experts</strong> as well as <strong>new participants and communities</strong> in a wide variety of industries; therefore needs both flexibility and formal structure.
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Goals</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow <strong>continuous development</strong> of specifications
		<li><strong>Simplify maintenance</strong> of existing W3C Recommendations
		<li>Secure <strong>patent commitments</strong> as soon as possible
		<li><strong>Reduce overhead</strong>
		<li>Continue the W3C commitment to <strong>Wide Review</strong> and <strong>consensus</strong>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Design Principles</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Contents of a <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> must fulfill the <strong>same requirements</strong> as currently.
		<li>Maintain single Process track for normative specifications.
		<li>Enable <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr>s to consistently maintain <strong>intended implementation target as the official publication</strong> on w3.org/TR
		<li>Wide review invites participation of the broader community, not just experts.
		<li>Patent protection for early implementations and on continuously-developed specs.
		<li>Improve on existing Process, don't rewrite from scratch.
	</ul>
</div>

		<li><strong>Updating the Patent Policy</strong>
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Streamlining Routine CR Republication Approvals</h1>
	<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Republishing WDs is automatic given WG approval, but republishing CR requires Director’s approval. Most republication requests, however, are routine and don’t need much scrutiny.
	<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Allow automatic Director’s approval for straightforward cases, e.g.
	<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
		<li>Documented <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr> decision to publish
		<li>All changes documented
		<li>Horizontal Review groups have approved or waived their review
		<li>Resolution of each issue was satisfactory to commenter(s)
		<li>No formal objections
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Allow <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> Drafts between <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> Snapshots</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<p><strong>Currently:</strong> Updating a <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> requires external verification of work and triggers a patent exclusion period. Accommodating these reviews slows updates. (Even if we speed up Director’s approvals, legal teams want infrequent patent reviews.)
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> publications lag, often significantly, behind <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr>’s current-work, reducing value and authority of W3C’s official publications.
		<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Address use case of Living Standards: always up-to-date, periodic patent commitment</p>
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Allow <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> draft publications between <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> snapshot publications:
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li><strong>CR Snapshot publication</strong> requires wide review, Director's approval, triggers patent review
			<li><strong>CR Draft publication</strong> can be published by the <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr> without approval, no patent review
				<ul style='margin-top: 0; font-size: small'>
					<li>Significant changes since last snapshot must be tracked to facilitate review
					<li>Spec header adds links to previous Patent Review publication as well as previous [generic] publication.
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Modifying a Recommendation</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Problem:</strong> Fixing errors in <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> requires returning entire spec to <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr>, re-doing Process from there.
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li>Confuses users (because the spec “loses” <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> status).
			<li>Excessive process &amp; publication work for <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr>s and Staff.
			<li>Results in poorly-maintained <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>s.
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Make it easy to propose, review, and incorporate individual changes without destabilizing the entire <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>.
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Create an errata proposal + approval process:
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li><strong>Inline Errata -</strong> Allow <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr>s to republish annotated <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>s, noting <strong>proposed changes</strong>.
			<li><strong>Review of Proposed Changes -</strong> Combine transition-like checks for wide review, adequate implementation, plus AC and patent reviews on proposed <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> with selected changes.
			<li><strong>Updated <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> -</strong> Reviewed changes can then be folded directly into an updated <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>.
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Allow Adding Features to a <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr></h1>
	<div class="note">
		<ul>
			<li>Some communities need a specification to represent a stable feature set.
			<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Some communities need a specification to represent continuous development.
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Currently:</strong> <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> specifications cannot accept new features; a new level of the technology must be specified starting with a new <abbr title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</abbr>.
		<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Re-use <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> maintenance process for incorporating <strong>proposed changes</strong> (above) to also allow incorporating <strong>proposed additions</strong>.
		<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only allowed if stated in the specification prior to first publication as <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>.
	</div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Patent Policy Improvements</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Patents licenses are only granted after REC, but implementations needed before REC.
		<br><strong>Goal:</strong> Secure patent commitments earlier, without depending on meeting REC requirements.
		<p><strong>Currently:</strong> We secure promises to license at each exclusion opportunity, but only licenses at REC.
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Secure licensing, rather than just commitments to license:
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li>on <strong>full specification</strong>, by all WG participants, at the end of each exclusion period from CR onwards
			<li><del>on each <strong>contribution</strong>, by the contributor, at the time of contribution</del> <i>not addressed in current PSIG update</i>

	<h1>Impact</h1>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Working Groups</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Allow easier maintenance paths for its Recommendations (changes and additions)
		<li>Allow keeping <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> publications in sync with latest edits, without waiting on Director approval
		<li>Secure Patent Commitments earlier than <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>:<br>
		    Full specification commitments at the end of each exclusion period, starting at <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr>
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Advisory Committee & Legal Teams</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>AC/Patent reviews would be more frequent but with finer granularity
			<ul>
				<li>Formal patent / AC reviews rate-limited to approximately once per six months
			</ul>
			<li>Full specification commitments earlier than <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr>, at <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr>
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Horizontal Review</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>HR groups are already under a heavy workload
			<ul>
				<li>Increasing frequency of review is good, but context-switching is costly.
				<li>Improving tooling for more granular feature review is essential to success</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Proposed fix continues to require demonstration of review at transitions/updates
			<ul>
				<li>Tied to <abbr title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</abbr> Review Drafts and <abbr title="Recommendation">REC</abbr> Call for Reviews (rate-limited already for legal).
				<li>Patent commitments may stall if review is slow, or if <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr> has failed to coordinate with HR.
			</ul>
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Implementers and Users</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Early implementations get W3C <abbr title="Royalty-Free">RF</abbr> commitments
		<li>Official specifications (on <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/'>w3.org</a>) reflect latest <abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr> thinking.
		<li>Improved maintenance brings W3C Recommendations closer to reality.
		<li>Granular reviews of proposed changes to Recommendations.
	</ol>
