Hi! This is fantasai. Florian and I are going to talk today a bit about the W3C Process proposal for 2020.
For those of you who don't know, the W3C Process is the governing document for the standardization activites at W3C. The proposed changes for 2020 represent some of the biggest changes to the Process in many years. The purpose of this presentation is to help you, the AC, understand the motivation behind these changes as well as the nature of the proposed changes themselves. The Process 2020 proposal is currently under informal review in the AC, so please send us your questions and comments. We will be putting the revised Process forward for formal ratification by the AC after this comment period ends on May 31st.

Specifications go through initial periods of development and evolution, and as they stabilize, gradually transition to maintenance. W3C's Process currently has deficiencies in both phases.

For the development aspect, one major problem is that the current Process cannot easily represent the continuous model under which many software engineering teams operate. Forking the specification into REC snapshots that represent an arbitrary set of features passing the implementation requirements at a given point in time is busy-work to such engineers and the proliferation of copies increases the risk that the rest of the material gets out-of-sync with bugfixes.

Compounding this, for the maintenance aspect, every change to a Recommendation requires a lot of Process machinery that affects the status of the entire specification. Folding a single bugfix requires three changes in maturity level and corresponding manual publications and communications for the W3C staff, and by changing the status of the entire spec creates confusion about the maturity of the spec to its users.

It is evident that the current W3C Process is not working as well as it ought to. We can see this in the number of out-of-date and unmaintained specifications, and in the way work is shifting out of W3C Working Groups to other forums. Some projects have shifted out of W3C to WHATWG, others are not formally adopted in a Working Group until implementations have already shipped, too late for significant feedback to be taken into account. And in many groups where work is still officially happening at W3C, the official specifications we publish on W3C's own website are years out-of-date, with the active documents published elsewhere. This creates confusion between which of the two implementers and reviewers should reference, and results in interop problems.

Clearly, we need to fix the Process. But in so doing, we want to also make sure we don't lose the qualities that make it valuable in the first place.

W3C's goal is to develop well thought-out, implementable, and relevant specifications. We value wide review, implementation experience, consensus, and royalty-free licensing as the means to that end. The role of the Process, ultimately, is to ensure that these values are deeply incorporated into the W3C standardization process; it exists for no other reason than to provide a repeatable framework for this.

It's also important to note that the W3C community is very diverse. The Process needs to accommodate wide variety of companies and industries, and to solicit excellence from both experienced standards experts in well-established Working Groups as well as new participants and communities freshly started. To be a consistent, supportive framework, the Process needs both flexibility, and also formal structure. We can't continue to demand that Working Groups conform to a process that does not suit their operational reality. We also can't just eliminiate all formalisms in favor of cultural expectations and expect that to work.

As Tim Berners-Lee likes to say, the Process is a tool. If it's not useful, it needs to be adjusted. So in 2020, we are going to adjust the Process.

Our goals in adjusting this tool are:
- to allow continuous development of specifications so that they can evolve in sync with their respective implementations
- to simplify maintenance of existing and future W3C Recomendations
- to secure patent commitments to protect the pioneering implementations who secure our requirements for implementation experience as well as those that come after
- to reduce unnecessary bureaucratic overhead
- to continue to the W3C commitment to wide review and consensus

To implement these goals, we adopted the following principles:
First, the normative contents of a W3C Recommendation must continue to fulfil the same requirements as they currently do. We are not proposing to reduce the value proposition of a Recommendation. It must still satisfy the existing requirements for wide review, AC review, implementation experience, and director's approval.

Second, we resolved to make improvements to W3C's existing Recommendation Track for normative specifications, not to create a parallel track for the same purpose but under different process requirements and procedures.

Third, we want to enable Working Groups to consistently maintain their intended implementation target as their official spec publication on w3.org, such that off-site Editor's drafts are no longer needed in a public-facing role. If we do not enable this in practical terms, we have failed as a standards organization: our purpose is to publish relevant standards, if what we publish on our website is not relevant, what are we even doing?

Fourth, we want to make sure that “wide review” in the Process invites the participation of the broader community, not just experts. Many people refer to review by horizontal working groups such as accessibility and the TAG as “wide review”; but this is *part of* wide review. Wide review also includes the broader public, that is why W3C has always published it's work for free on the Web. If relevant review materials are only ever available in the depths of a GitHub repository, they will not receive wide review. Therefore Process 2020 attempts to ensure that new material can be published *for* wide review, not just after “wide review”.

Fifth, we want to bring patent protection to early implementations and for continuously-developed specifications. Many W3C specifications describe complex technology in extreme detail, and the refinement of these details take place in the Candidate Recommendation phase, during which we invite implementations to help us figure them out. We want these implementations to have the same protections as later implementations do after the specification reaches REC.

Lastly, we intend to improve on the existing Process, not to rewrite from scratch. The W3C Process has served us well in many ways for over a quarter century, we don't want to lose the positive aspects of the existing Process we have in order to fix its deficiencies. Reforming the Process rather than replacing it reduces the risk of regressions, and also makes the transition to the new process much easier. Every change is additive and independent: Process 2020 reduces the friction from many procedures and makes some new things possible, but existing ways of working remain valid.

I hope this helps you understand why the Process needs to change, and why we are proposing the changes that we are. And now I will hand off to my indefatigable co-editor, Florian Rivoal, to explain the specific changes in this package of reforms.
